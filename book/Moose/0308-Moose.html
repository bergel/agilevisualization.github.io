      <h2> Analyzing Software using Moose</h2>
<p>Moose is a platform for data and software analysis. Moose is the result of a collaborative effort, initiated at the University of Bern, which now comprise several compagnies and research groups spread all over the World. The main website of Moose is http://moosetechnology.org. </p>
<p>Moose is often used to craft specific software engineering tools, such tools guiding engineers to make proper decisions about the course of a software development. Humane Assessment is a method designed by Tudor Gîba and largely described on the website http://www.humane-assessment.com.</p>

<p><em>What Moose is good for:</em> Moose is made to carry out analysis on the source code structure. A whole range of analysis may be conducted by analysis source code. Moose is also frequently used to analyze configuration files, process description, mailing list. </p>
<p>Data processing may be automatized. Embedding Pharo within a batch job is easy and is a practical monitoring solution.</p>
<p><em>What Moose is not good for:</em> Moose cannot directly be used to analyse the dynamic execution of an application. Dynamic analysis consists in recording relevant information during a program execution. Such information may then be used to spot particular behavior. </p>
<h3>1.  Moose in a nutshell</h3>
<p>The core of Moose is composed of:</p><ul><li> <em>Panel</em>: An extensible tool to navigate, visualize, and formulate queries.</li><li> <em>Parsers</em>: Two parsers are shipped with Moose. MSE is a file-format describe source code models. MSE is typically produced by externally provided parsers. </li><li> <em>The Famix metamodel</em>: An abstract representation of source code. Famix is generic and it may describes application written in Java, C, C#, and Pharo.</li><li> <em>Chef</em>: A domain-specific language to query structural dependencies. Analysis the dependencies between software elements is particularly difficult. Chef allows one to precisely formulate queries </li></ul>
<h3>2.  Loading a software application</h3>
<p>Creating a model in Moose is probably the very first step to take. Such model will then define the Universe in which your analyse will be carried out. The standard way to create a model is to load an application. To do so, the Moose panel has to be open. The panel is accessible from the World menu (Figure <a href="#mooseOpeningBrowser">2.1</a>).</p>
<p><a name="mooseOpeningBrowser"></a><figure><img src="figures/mooseOpeningBrowser.png" width="80%"></img><figcaption>2.1. Opening the Moose Panel</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Moose has two built-in parsers: one for Pharo, and another for MSE. The first parser is accessible by clicking on the <strong>ST</strong> icon, top-right of the Moose Panel. Clicking on it will open a package selector. You simply have to select the Pharo packages you wish to includes in your model. The second parser takes as input a MSE file, accessible by clicking on the <strong>MSE</strong> button. </p>
<p>MSE is a file format that describe source code. Consider the following Java code:</p>
<p><figure><pre><code class="smalltalk">	package agilevisualization.example;

	public class HelloWorld {
	    public static void main(String[] argv) {
		System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
	    }
	}</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The corresponding MSE file of that code is long of 48 lines. The first few lines are:</p>
<p><figure><pre><code class="smalltalk">(
	(FAMIX.Inheritance (id: 3)
		(subclass (ref: 10))
		(superclass (ref: 4)))
	(FAMIX.Class (id: 4)
		(name 'Object')
		(container (ref: 7))
		(isStub true))
	(FAMIX.FileAnchor (id: 5)
		(element (ref: 1))
		(endLine 6)
		(fileName './agilevisualization/example/HelloWorld.java')
		(startLine 4))
	(FAMIX.FileAnchor (id: 6)
		(element (ref: 10))
		(endLine 7)
		(fileName './agilevisualization/example/HelloWorld.java')
		(startLine 3))
	...
)</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Producing a MSE file from Java source code is done using VerveineJ, 
Unfortunately, at the time this chapter is being written, VerveineJ has a proprietary licence. Contact the book author or the Moose mailing list for more information.</p>
<p>Along this chapter, we will use a running example, obtained from the Java application checkstyle. Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard. The source code of Checkstyle is available from its website: <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net">http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net</a>. We have produced a MSE file, available on <a href="http://bit.ly/checkstyle">http://bit.ly/checkstyle</a>.</p>

<h3>3.  Browsing the source code</h3>
<p>After having loaded the checkstyle MSE file, a new model is listed in the Moose (Figure <a href="#mooseCheckstyleInPanel">3.1</a>). </p>
<p><a name="mooseCheckstyleInPanel"></a><figure><img src="figures/mooseCheckstyleInPanel.png" width="60%"></img><figcaption>3.1. Loading checkstyle</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Selecting the checkstyle model in the panel gives you a long list of kind of entities presents in the model. The panel indicates a few interesting facts about Checkstyle. In particular, Checkstyle is composed of </p><ul><li> 4,824 methods (item <em>All methods</em>)</li><li> 1,011 classes (item <em>All model classes</em>)</li><li> 36 packages (item <em>All model namespaces</em>)</li></ul>
<p>The item <em>All classes</em> lists all the classes defined in the application and all the classes used by checkstyle that are not define in it. Example of such classes are <code>Object</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Integer</code>, which are defined in the Java runtime.</p>
<p>Select the <em>All model classes</em> item to list all the classes defined in the applications. Below the list of classes, a text input accepts filtering queries. Enter <code>each numberOfMethods &gt; 30</code>. A third pane appears and list the classes defined in checkstyle that have more than 30 methods (Figure <a href="#moreThan30Lines">3.2</a>). </p>
<p><a name="moreThan30Lines"></a><figure><img src="figures/mooseMoreThan30Lines.png" width="100%"></img><figcaption>3.2. Querying in the panel</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Since the item displayed in the panel <em>All model classes</em> are instances of the class <code>FAMIXClass</code>, the <code>each</code> variable refers to an <code>FAMIXClass</code>. Browsing this class using the Pharo code browser will give you the list of methods that are understandable by the <code>each</code> variable.</p>
<p>Queries involing the class name are also often formulated. For example, the query 
<figure><pre><code class="smalltalk">	'*Log*' match: each name </code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure> designates classes defined in Checkstyle that have the word <code>Log</code> in their name. The string being an expression regular, matched using <code>match:</code>.</p>
<p>Another interesting query is <code>each isStub</code> (you need to select the item <em>All classes</em> instead). This simple query list only the classes that are considered as stub. In a Moose jargon, a stub class is a class that is used by the analyzed application but not defined in it. Checkstyle contains 398 stub classes, corresponding to classes defined in other libraries, not part of the .MSE file. For example, Checkstyle depends on some libraries provided by the Apache foundation or Google. These libraries are not part of the .MSE file. </p>

<p>Query may be relatively complex. For example, consider:
<figure><pre><code class="smalltalk">	each numberOfMethodsOverriden &gt; (each numberOfMethodsInherited / 3)</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
This query returns the classes that override more than 1/3 of the classes that it inherits. Such classes are rather suspicious since it may be worth considering whether they belongs to the adequate class hierarchy.</p>
<h3>4.  Visualizing the code distribution</h3>
<p>Checkstyle contains more than one thousand classes, distributed over 36 packages. Understanding the code distribution over these packages may involve a dedicated visualization. After having selected the checkstyle model, select the packages by pressing <em>All model namespaces</em>. The new pane located on the right-hand side lists these packages. Oddly enough, the packages <code>&lt;Default Package&gt;</code> and <code>blah</code> are listed. </p>
<p>Pressing the <code>[|]</code> tab on the right pane allows one to enter a script. The <code>self</code> variable is then bound to the collection of packages. Enter the script (Figure <a href="#mooseCodeInPackageDistribution">4.1</a>):
<figure><pre><code class="smalltalk">	b := RTMondrian new.
	b nodes: (self reverseSortedAs: #numberOfClasses).
	b layout flow.
	b normalizer 
		normalizeWidth: #numberOfClasses max: 100;
		normalizeHeight: #numberOfLinesOfCode max: 100.
	b</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><a name="mooseCodeInPackageDistribution"></a><figure><img src="figures/mooseCodeInPackageDistribution.png" width="100%"></img><figcaption>4.1. Querying in the panel</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>This simple visualization shows that not all the packages contains the same amount of code. The first package, the largest, is <code>com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle</code>. Clicking on the package shows up a new pane. The second tab gives the list of properties for that package. In indicates that it defines 142 classes, spread over 5,617 lines of code.</p>
<p>Clicking on the entry <em>Types</em> lists all the classes defined in the package <code>checkstyle</code>. The following script reveals a number of facts regarding these 142 classes (Figure <a href="#mooseClassesInTheLargestPackage">4.2</a>):</p>
<p><figure><pre><code class="smalltalk">	b := RTMondrian new.
	b shape rectangle 
		width: #numberOfAttributes;
		height: #numberOfMethods.
	b nodes: (self reverseSortedAs: #numberOfMethods).
	b edges connectFrom: #superclass.
	b normalizer
		normalizeColor: #numberOfLinesOfCode.
	b layout flow.
	b</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><a name="mooseClassesInTheLargestPackage"></a><figure><img src="figures/mooseClassesInTheLargestPackage.png" width="100%"></img><figcaption>4.2. Classes in the largest package</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Most of the classes are small, in terms of lines of code, number of defines methods and attributes. Moreover, only two of these classes are subclasses.</p>

<h3>5.  Visualizing cross-cutting concerns</h3>
<p>Cross-cutting features are features that crosscut software structural entities, such as classes or packages. Due to their nature, cross-cutting are not explicitely modularized, and may therefore lead to some code anomalies. Consider the following script executed on the list of model classes (Figure <a href="#mooseCrosscuttingConcern">5.1</a>):</p>
<p><figure><pre><code class="smalltalk">	b := RTMondrian new.
	b shape box
		if: [ :c | c methods anySatisfy: [ :m | '*error*' match: m name ] ] 
			fillColor: Color blue;
		if: [ :c | c methods anySatisfy: [ :m | 'visit*' match: m name ] ] 
			fillColor: Color red.
	b nodes: self.
	b edges connectFrom: #superclass.
	b layout tree.
	b normalizer 
		normalizeHeight: #numberOfMethods max: 100;
		normalizeWidth: #numberOfAttributes max: 100.
 
	b build.
	b view @ RTDoubleScrollBar.
	b view</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><a name="mooseCrosscuttingConcern"></a><figure><img src="figures/mooseCrosscuttingConcern.png" width="100%"></img><figcaption>5.1. Visualizing cross-cutting concerns</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The script paints in blue classes that have at least one method with the word <code>error</code> in it and in red classes that are visiting some entities. The hierarchy of red classes indicates a specialization of visitors. It is also interesting to notice that errors are so rarely handled.</p>
<h3>6.  Dependencies using Moose Chef</h3>
<p>Moose chef is an API allowing to query dependencies between packages, classes, and methods. Consider the following script, running on the list of model classes (Figure <a href="#mooseDependenciesBetweenClasses">6.1</a>):</p>
<p><figure><pre><code class="smalltalk">	b := RTMondrian new.
	b nodes: self.
	b edges connectFrom: #superclass.
	b layout cluster.
	b shape 
		bezierLineFollowing: #superclass;
		color: Color blue.
	b edges
		notUseInLayout;
		connectToAll: [ :cls | cls queryAllOutgoingInvocations atTypeScope ]. 
	b</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><a name="mooseDependenciesBetweenClasses"></a><figure><img src="figures/mooseDependenciesBetweenClasses.png" width="100%"></img><figcaption>6.1. Dependencies between classes</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Sending the message <code>queryAllOutgoingInvocations</code> to a Famix class returns a list of Famix invocations. An invocation is an instance of the Famix class <code>FAMIXInvocation</code>. Invocations represents a low level abstract that often need to be transformed. Such transformation is called setting a scope by Moose Chef. 
The invocations may be scoped to the classes by sending <code>atTypeScope</code>. For a given Famix class <code>cls</code>, the expression <code>cls queryAllOutgoingInvocations atTypeScope</code> returns the list of Famix classes that <code>cls</code> depends on. A Chef query may be scoped using <code>atNamespaceScope</code>, <code>atPackageScope</code>, <code>atTypeScope</code>, <code>atMethodScope</code>.</p>

<h3>7.  More on that topic</h3>
<p>Moose is a large project that contains many exciting facets. This chapter only superficially highlights some of them. Another good source of documentation is the Moose Book (<a href="http://www.themoosebook.org/book">http://www.themoosebook.org/book</a>), project leaded by Dr. Tudor Gîrba <a href="http://www.tudorgirba.com">http://www.tudorgirba.com</a>. </p>
<p>Numerous research articles have been using Moose. Many of them are accessible from:</p><ul><li> http://rmod.inria.fr/web/publications</li><li> http://scg.unibe.ch/publications/scg-pub</li></ul>
